# Net Core 5 Basic DDD Architecture with GraphQL

Basic DDD structure with GraphQL to refer as a base project to understand better how this works.

## Installation

Pretty straightforward, just modify the appsettings.json file located on GraphQLServer and DDD.NET.CORE.API projects by replacing your database connection.

```bash
DDD.NET.CORE.API/appsettings.json

GraphQLServer/appsettings.json
```

## Usage

1. Set the DDD.NET.CORE.API as the main project on the presentation layer
2. Open package administrator console, set the default project as DDD.NET.CORE.INFRAESTRUCTURE and apply the following commands:
```bash
add-migration Initial
update-database
```
3. Run the project after replacing the appsettings.json 

Nugget libraries used on the DDD project:

```bash
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
```

Nugget libraries used on the GraphQL project:

```bash
HotChocolate.AspNetCore
HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Playground
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```

4. When using GraphQL, set GraphQLServer as default project, then run again. 
To open Playground and start testing GraphQL make sure to access the following URL, then paste the queries attached below and click the play button on playground client.
```bash
https://localhost:44371/playground/
```

```bash
#Get all cars
query{
  cars{
    id
    name
    model
    engine
  }
}

#Create a car
mutation {
  create(car: {name:"FordCar", model:"Ford", engine:"V34"}){
    name
    model
    engine
  }
}

#Delete a car
